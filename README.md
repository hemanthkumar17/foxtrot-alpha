# Foxtrot Alpha

A project that brings a challenge-based learning platform in the form of a webapp
Induces the urge to learn by a game-like feel
Runs on flutter's web support

The prototype included in this is incomplete which consists of the necessary UX in /lib/api/ and models in /lib/model/ which will be used to build the views as defined in /lib/views/readme.md.

Each challeger can initiate a challenge to challenge a random challenger in this platform and gain or lose points this way(thresholded by 50 points, base of 100 points on registration).

Host using ``flutter run -d web-server --web-port 8887``
